This template is a revision of the outdated LaTeX template offered by the graphics department of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig abd it adjusts to the guidelines of the Institute. The code is absolutely not guaranteed, although it runs smoothly in my computer :).

You should be able to twick everything you need directly from the main tex file without modifying the template file, but feel free to modify the template as much as you want. I would recommend to keep design and content as separate as possible, so try to use the template file (or an additional custom \input{}) to add additional packages / definitions, etc. The paddings are computed for their use with columns, so even if you want a single-column arrangement I would recommend to embed it in a column environment (although you can also recompute the paddings relatively easy). I haven't tried it using a landscape orientation so you might need to modify the template for that O:).

If you change the colour scheme or the paddings there is a risk the graphics department won't print your poster, so try to keep track of the changes in case you need to revert them! Happy BeamerPostering! ;)
